The goals in this assignment are as follows:

Select a dataset in either a .TXT or a .CSV file format (text file that is comma-delimited,tab-delimited or other standard plain text format)
If your dataset has less than 300 records, please see me before you proceed.
Write a .SQL script to import the data into MySQL using your MySQL database that you created for use with i6.cims.nyu.edu
Write 10 queries to analyse your data as noted below.
Once you have successfully imported the data into MySQL, write the following ten queries:

Write a query to count how many records there are in your table.
Write a query to logically group the data in your table and print out only the last (or highest) record in each category.
Display three important fields; at least one should be in alphabetical order; show only the first 10 records in the table.
Use GROUP BY to find the averages on a numerical field in a reasonable breakdown?
Create a user-friendly listing of the first 15 records in alphabetical order. (For example, in class we listed books as follows:	
Shakespeare Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (Signet Classics, 1603)
6. – 10. Write five more queries that are relevant to your data and and yield interesting results.

Write up your results as follows:

Write a brief report containing the following information using the text-editor of your choice and submit the report as a .PDF file or plain text file:

the URL where you obtained the data
one or several sentences describing the nature of the data that you downloaded (e.g. These are records listing the name, address and contact information for wi-fi hotspots across New York City.)
Write one or more paragraphs (about a half page) describing what you have learned from your data analysis.
What to submit:

Go to NYU/Classes and submit the following:

Your report about the data (including the URL and comments as noted above)
your MySQL script (.sql file) that you used to load the data
your MySQL script (.sql file) that you used to run the queries (Note: You may submit a a copy of your Terminal session as a text file with your queries if you prefer.)
a copy of the data file which you obtained from the web
Data Sources and Extra Credit:

If you need to “scrub” your data using Python, you may request extra credit. If so, please submit the python program that you wrote along with the original data file and URL.
